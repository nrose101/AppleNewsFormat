As you can see this text is now starting in the second column, i.e. the one at index 1, and spanning two of the three columns defined in the overall document. But because this is adaptive layout you will only see all three columns displayed when the available screen area is large enough to do so. At other times the layout will adapt and components will run one after the other rather than in columns. Viewed on a regular-sized iPad in portrait, for example, you will see this text component beneath the previous one (in a rather awkward way!), but turn into landscape orientation and you see the columns side by side. On the iPad Pro in portrait and landscape you will see the columns side by side because space allows it.",
